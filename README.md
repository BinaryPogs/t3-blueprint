### Local Development with Webhook

## Additional Notes

- The webhook integration automatically syncs user data between Clerk and your PostgreSQL database
- Make sure your PostgreSQL database is running before starting the application
- Keep your environment variables secure and never commit them to version control

## Common Issues

1. **Webhook not working locally**: Make sure unTun is running and your webhook URL is correctly set in Clerk dashboard
2. **Database connection issues**: Verify your DATABASE_URL is correct and PostgreSQL is running
3. **Missing environment variables**: Ensure all required variables are set in your .env file
